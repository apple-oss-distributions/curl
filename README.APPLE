The 'curl' subdirectory is based on curl 7.51.0

== Updating ==

Confirm/update versions in xcconfigs/libcurl-version.xcconfig
 - This will probably require building the regular open source version and running otool on the resulting library.

Update CURL_SUPPORT_* in xcconfigs/common.xcconfig
 - Run configure, check config.status

If options change (see below), update CURL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS in xcconfigs/common.xcconfig

Make sure all files are being compiled.
curl: CURL_CFILES and CURLX_CFILES in curl/src/Makefile.inc 
libcurl: LIB_CFILES and LIB_VTLS_CFILES in curl/lib/Makefile.inc
The Xcode targets list the files in the same order.
Might be able to process the Makefile.inc files into Xcode file lists at some point.

Make sure all man pages and headers are being installed.

Update xcscripts/install_libtest.sh (see comment at top) -- NOTE: This hasn't been updated in quite some time, see radar:17812072

== Configuration ==

./configure --with-gssapi --enable-hidden-symbols --disable-static --enable-threaded-resolver --with-darwinssl --without-libssh2

Changes to include/curl/curlbuild.h post-configure:
  (1) Add #ifdef __LP64__ for CURL_SIZEOF_LONG.
  (2) Change CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_OFF_T and associated defines to int64_t (configure gets it wrong for 32-bit).
		(requires CURL_PULL_STDINT_H, CURL_PULL_INTTYPES_H)

Changes to lib/curl_config.h post-configure:
  (1) Add #ifdef __LP64__ for SIZEOF_LONG, SIZEOF_SIZE_T, SIZEOF_TIME_T, SIZEOF_VOIDP
  (2) #undef HAVE_GSSAPI, OS - conditionally defined in common.xcconfig
  (3) #undef CURL_CA_BUNDLE - not available everywhere, and we currently use SecureTransport
