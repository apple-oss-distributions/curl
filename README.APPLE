The 'curl' subdirectory is based on ^/curl/vendor/curl-7.24.0

== Updating ==

Confirm/update versions in xcconfigs/libcurl.xcconfig
 - This will probably require building the regular open source version and running otool on the resulting library.

Update CURL_SUPPORT_* in xcconfigs/common.xcconfig
 - Run configure, check config.status

If options change (see below), update CURL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS in xcconfigs/common.xcconfig

Make sure all files are being compiled.
curl: CURL_CFILES and CURLX_ONES in curl/src/Makefile.inc 
libcurl: CSOURCES in curl/lib/Makefile.inc
The Xcode targets list the files in the same order.
Might be able to process the Makefile.inc files into Xcode file lists at some point.

== Configuration ==

./configure --with-gssapi --enable-hidden-symbols --disable-static --enable-threaded-resolver

Changes to include/curl/curlbuild.h post-configure:
  (1) Add #ifdef __LP64__ for CURL_SIZEOF_LONG.
  (2) Change CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_OFF_T and associated defines to int64_t (configure gets it wrong for 32-bit).
		(requires CURL_PULL_STDINT_H, CURL_PULL_INTTYPES_H)

Changes to (lib|src)/curl_config.h post-configure:
  (1) Add #ifdef __LP64__ for SIZEOF_LONG, SIZEOF_SIZE_T, SIZEOF_TIME_T, SIZEOF_VOIDP
  (2) #undef HAVE_GSSAPI, USE_OPENSSL, USE_SSLEAY, OS - conditionally defined in common.xcconfig
